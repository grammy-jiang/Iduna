One of the most powerful parts of Django is the automatic admin interface. It reads
metadata from your models to provide a quick, model-centric interface where trusted
users can manage content on your site. The admin’s recommended use is limited to an
organization’s internal management tool. It’s not intended for building your entire
front end around.
